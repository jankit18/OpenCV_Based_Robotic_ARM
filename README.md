# Live Feed based Automated Robotic Arm

Servo Based Robotic Arm integrated with a camera made to perform the task of picking an object by just clicking on it in a live video feed. A python module OpenCV is used for the detection of object centroid which is served as target coordinate for the robotic arm. Using the camera coordinate and the target coordinate the arm movement can be calculated using simple trigonometry
